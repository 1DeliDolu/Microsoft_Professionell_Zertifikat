### 1. Question 1

Based on performance optimization strategies, what is the primary benefit of caching API responses in a Blazor application?

* [X] It reduces redundant requests by temporarily storing frequently accessed data
* [ ] It synchronizes data updates across multiple devices in real time
* [ ] It improves the speed of complex calculations on the client side
* [ ] It minimizes memory usage in the browser

### 2. Question 2

What is a key advantage of implementing authentication tokens in Blazor API integration?

* [ ] They improve application performance by compressing API payloads
* [X] They ensure secure access to APIs by verifying client identity
* [ ] They provide detailed error messages for debugging purposes
* [ ] They enable the API to handle real-time communication efficiently

---

### 3. Question 3

How can developers efficiently handle large datasets when integrating APIs in Blazor applications?

* [ ] Send multiple simultaneous requests to retrieve the entire dataset
* [ ] Increase the server's response size limit to allow larger payloads
* [ ] Cache all datasets in memory for faster access
* [X] Implement pagination to load data in smaller chunks dynamically

---

### 4. Question 4

When implementing error logging in a Blazor application, what is the primary advantage of using a dedicated error logging service?

* [ ] It automatically fixes runtime errors during API calls
* [ ] It reduces the need for manual testing by simulating API responses
* [ ] It improves data transfer speeds between the client and the server
* [X] It ensures runtime errors are captured and analyzed for improved reliability
