# Activity: Optimizing Integration Code for Performance Using Microsoft Copilot


### **Activity Introduction**

To complete this project, you’ll demonstrate your ability to build and optimize a full-stack application, InventoryHub, using Microsoft Copilot. The project integrates the work you completed in three previous activities and focuses on creating seamless communication between the front-end and back-end, resolving integration issues, structuring JSON responses, and optimizing performance.

This is the final of four activities in the capstone project. After this, you’ll submit your project for review and feedback. 


### **Activity Instructions**

## Step 1:  Review your completed activities

Ensure you have completed and saved the work from the following activities:

1. **Activity 1**: Generated and refined integration code for seamless front-end and back-end communication.
2. **Activity 2**: Debugged and resolved integration issues.
3. **Activity 3**: Implemented JSON structures for API responses in the back-end.

## Step 2: Consolidate your code into a single project

1. Combine the code from all three activities into a unified project structure:
   * Include the Blazor front-end and Minimal API back-end projects.
   * Ensure that the JSON response from the back-end is correctly consumed by the front-end.
   * Test the integration thoroughly to confirm that the data flows as intended.
2. Document your code:
   * Add comments explaining how Copilot contributed to the development process.
   * Highlight any specific areas where Copilot improved efficiency or suggested optimizations.

## Step 3: Optimize the application for performance

1. Use Copilot to:
   * Identify and reduce redundant API calls in the front-end.
   * Implement caching strategies in the back-end to minimize server load.
   * Refactor any repetitive or inefficient code in both projects.
2. Test the optimized code:
   * Measure the performance improvements using browser developer tools or profiling tools in Visual Studio Code.
   * Confirm that the optimizations do not introduce new bugs or regressions.

## Step 4: Write your reflective summary

Include a reflective summary in a markdown file (REFLECTION.md) or as part of your project README:

1. Explain how Copilot assisted in generating integration code, debugging issues, structuring JSON responses, and optimizing performance.
2. Highlight any challenges you encountered and how Copilot helped you overcome them.
3. Discuss what you learned about using Copilot effectively in a full-stack development context.

## Step 5: Save your work

By the end of this project, you will have:

* A fully functional and optimized **InventoryHub** application with seamless front-end and back-end communication.
* Debugged and validated code that follows best practices for integration and performance.
* A reflective understanding of how Microsoft Copilot can assist in full-stack development tasks.

Save your work. For submission, you’ll deploy your completed project to a GitHub repository. There are instructions for this process in the upcoming peer-review activity, during which you’ll submit the project for peer review and feedback.
