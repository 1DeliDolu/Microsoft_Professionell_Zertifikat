<h1>InventoryHub</h1>

<p>
    This project is a simple full‑stack demo that connects a Blazor WebAssembly
    front end with a Minimal API back end. The client fetches products from the
    API and renders them in a clean, readable table with basic error handling.

    Open the <strong>Fetch Products</strong> page to see live data pulled from
    the server.
