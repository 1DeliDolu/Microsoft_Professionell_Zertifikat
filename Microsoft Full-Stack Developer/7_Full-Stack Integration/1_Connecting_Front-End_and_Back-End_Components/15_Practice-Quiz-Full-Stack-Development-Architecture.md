* [ ] Render the user interface for user interaction
* [ ] Facilitate API calls between front-end and back-end
* [X] Store and organize persistent data for long-term use

That’s correct! Databases are essential for managing persistent data, such as user profiles or product details, enabling storage and retrieval across the application. Go to the video Components of Full-Stack Development to learn more.

### 3. Question 3

How do APIs contribute to full-stack application functionality?

* [ ] Ensure persistent data is securely stored
* [ ] Render UI components for user interaction
* [X] Enable structured communication between front-end and back-end components

That’s correct! APIs provide a structured mechanism for communication, allowing the front-end to consume data from the back-end and create dynamic functionality. Go to the video Introduction to Connecting Front-End and Back-End Components to learn more.

* [ ] Manage code changes in a development environment
