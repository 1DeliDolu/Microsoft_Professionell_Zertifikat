### 1. Question 1

What is a critical step in building RESTful APIs for front-end integration?

* [ ] Implementing session management through cookies
* [ ] Storing all application data within the API
* [ ] Designing user interfaces for applications
* [X] Defining endpoints to manage data exchange between the front-end and back-end

That’s correct! Defining endpoints ensures the API provides specific access points for managing data flow, enabling seamless integration.

---

### 2. Question 2

Which component of RESTful APIs is essential for facilitating data exchange?

* [ ] API documentation to explain functionality
* [ ] Middleware to authenticate users
* [ ] Headers that store metadata
* [X] HTTP methods that specify actions performed at API endpoints

That’s correct! HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE guide how data is retrieved, sent, or updated, enabling structured communication.

---

### 3. Question 3

What distinguishes RESTful APIs within the .NET Minimal API framework?

* [ ] Their focus on front-end design
* [ ] Their integration with third-party libraries for error handling
* [X] Their use of lightweight endpoints and HTTP methods for efficient communication

That’s correct! The .NET Minimal API framework emphasizes simplicity, leveraging endpoints and HTTP methods for fast and effective data handling.

* [ ] Their reliance on JSON for server-to-server communication only

---

### 4. Question 4

How does System.Text.Json facilitate data exchange in RESTful APIs?

* [ ] By querying databases to fetch information
* [ ] By compressing JSON payloads for faster transmission
* [X] By serializing objects into JSON format and deserializing JSON back into objects

That’s correct! Serialization and deserialization allow efficient data transfer between the front-end and back-end using JSON.

* [ ] By encrypting JSON data for secure communication

---

### 5. Question 5

What is a fundamental step in building a RESTful API using Express.js in a back-end environment?

* [ ] Deploying the API directly to the production environment
* [ ] Implementing middleware for managing UI components
* [X] Defining routes that handle specific HTTP methods for resource interaction

That’s correct! Defining routes allows the API to process client requests for creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources.

* [ ] Using System.Text.Json for serialization
