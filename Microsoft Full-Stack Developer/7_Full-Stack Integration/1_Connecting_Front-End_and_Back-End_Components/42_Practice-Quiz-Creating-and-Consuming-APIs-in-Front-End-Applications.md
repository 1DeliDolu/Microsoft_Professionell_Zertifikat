### 1. Question 1

What is the primary benefit of consuming APIs in front-end applications?

* [ ] It eliminates the need for back-end development.
* [X] It enables dynamic interaction with back-end data, allowing the UI to update in real-time.

That’s correct! Consuming APIs connects the front end with back-end services, ensuring the UI reflects current data.

* [ ] It automates the creation of front-end components.
* [ ] It prevents unauthorized access to the front-end application.

---

### 2. Question 2

What is the first step in creating an API for front-end applications?

* [ ] Structuring API responses using a format like JSON.
* [X] Identifying the data requirements of the front-end application.

That’s correct! Understanding the front-end’s data needs ensures the API is designed to provide relevant information efficiently.

* [ ] Implementing CORS for secure cross-origin requests.
* [ ] Configuring the API routes for endpoint mapping.

### 3. Question 3

What is the role of the HttpClient in Blazor applications?

* [ ] To host the Blazor application on the server.
* [ ] To manage error handling in the application.
* [X] To make API calls to retrieve or send data between the application and back-end services.

That’s correct! HttpClient enables Blazor applications to interact with APIs for fetching or updating data.

* [ ] To generate UI components dynamically.

---

### 4. Question 4

When consuming an API in Blazor, what is the purpose of binding data to UI components?

* [X] To dynamically render retrieved API data in the user interface.

That’s correct! Data binding ensures the UI components update based on the API responses dynamically.

* [ ] To secure API calls from unauthorized access.
* [ ] To set up the HttpClient service for the application.
* [ ] To prevent errors during API requests.

---

### 5. Question 5

How does consuming APIs in a Blazor-based front-end application enable data display?

* [ ] By embedding the data directly into the application at build time.
* [ ] By creating static pages that do not require updates.
* [ ] By using hardcoded values to simulate API responses.
* [X] By retrieving data through HttpClient and rendering it dynamically in components.

That’s correct! Using HttpClient allows Blazor to fetch data, which can then be displayed dynamically in the UI.

---

### 6. Question 6

What is a key step in implementing API consumption in a Blazor-based application?

* [ ] Using the API to directly modify back-end services.
* [ ] Displaying error messages directly in the back-end logs.
* [X] Registering HttpClient to enable API calls within the application.

That’s correct! Registering HttpClient is essential to configure the Blazor application for API communication.

* [ ] Hardcoding API data into Blazor components.
