### **Activity 2: Debugging API Code with Microsoft Copilot**

# Activity Introduction

Generative AI tools like Microsoft Copilot can streamline the debugging process and improve your final code output.

In this activity, you will use Copilot to debug the code you’ve started for your API project. This project will give you practice reviewing code, debugging, and implementing fixes. You’ll use Copilot to discover issues and suggest changes to improve your code.

**This is the second of three activities in which you will develop and code a back-end API project. The final output will be a working API project that you can use to demonstrate your understanding of back-end development.**

Before you start this activity, make sure you have completed the first activity in this module, Writing and Enhancing API Code with Copilot [LINK].

# Activity Instructions

## Step 1: Review the scenario

To begin, review the following scenario:

After deploying the initial version of the **User Management API**, **TechHive Solutions** reported several bugs. For example:

* Users were being added without proper validation.
* Errors occurred when retrieving non-existent users.
* The API occasionally crashed due to unhandled exceptions.

Your task is to debug the API using **Microsoft Copilot**, ensuring it works reliably and meets the company’s requirements.

## Step 2: Identify bugs

Next, start finding issues with the code you created previously.

* Use Copilot to analyze the existing codebase and identify issues.Examples:
  * Missing validation for user input fields (e.g., empty names or invalid emails).
  * Lack of error handling for failed database lookups.
  * Performance bottlenecks in the GET /users endpoint.

## Step 3: Fix bugs with Copilot

Then, use Copilot to fix any issues that you have identified.

* Use Copilot to:
  * Add validation to ensure only valid user data is processed.
  * Implement try-catch blocks to handle unhandled exceptions.
  * Optimize queries or logic to improve performance.

## Step 4: Test and validate fixes

Finally, test the debugged code to complete this project phase.

* Test the API endpoints again, focusing on edge cases (e.g., invalid input, non-existent IDs).
* Document how Copilot’s suggestions helped identify and resolve issues.

## Step 5: Save your work

By the end of this exercise, you should have a debugged and optimized User Management API and a summary of bugs fixed and how Copilot streamlined the debugging process. When completed, save your work. You will use this code in later activities.
