[ ]It is where the execution of the program begins, and without it, the program cannot run

[ ]It ensures that memory is allocated for the program

[ ]It allows for the inclusion of global variables in the program

[ ]It contains all the namespaces used in the program


### 2.

Question 2

Which of the following best describes a class in C#?

[ ]A structure for holding conditional logic

[ ]A template for defining functions and procedures

[ ]A blueprint for creating objects with defined attributes and behaviors

[ ]A container for storing temporary data


### 3.

Question 3

What is the purpose of a constructor in a C# class?

[ ]To initialize the object and assign values to its fields or properties

[ ]To define the behavior of an object during its lifetime

[ ]To assign methods to an object

[ ]To finalize the object before it is destroyed


### 4.

Question 4

Which of the following correctly defines a namespace in C#?

[ ]A collection of related classes and methods used to organize code and avoid name conflicts

[ ]A class that handles input and output operations

[ ]A block that allows you to access global variables across the program

[ ]A method to manage memory allocation

Question 5

What would happen if the required Main() method is missing from a C# program?

[ ]The program will compile successfully but return an empty result

[ ]The program will compile, but it will display no output

[ ]The program will fail to execute because the Main() method is required to define where program execution begins

[ ]The program will execute but will skip any output commands
