[ ]To format HTTP responses for the client

[ ]To handle user authentication and authorization for all incoming requests

[ ]To map incoming HTTP requests to specific functions based on URL patterns

[ ]To improve API performance by caching responses


### 2.

Question 2

Which of the following best describes attribute routing in ASP.NET Core?

[ ]It automatically generates routes based on the controller and action method names

[ ]It configures routes using a graphical interface in Visual Studio

[ ]It defines routes by decorating controllers or action methods with route attributes

### 3.

Question 3

How does attribute routing differ from conventional routing in ASP.NET Core?

[ ]Attribute routing does not allow route constraints, while conventional routing does

[ ]Attribute routing is configured through a graphical user interface, while conventional routing requires code changes

[ ]Attribute routing defines routes directly on controller actions, while conventional routing defines routes centrally in the Program.cs file

[ ]Attribute routing supports middleware-based dynamic route changes, while conventional routing does not


### 4.

Question 4

What does the question mark (?) in the route /products/{id:int?} signify?

[ ]The route parameter is optional

[ ]The route parameter is mandatory and must always be included in requests
