Question 1

What is the purpose of the Program.cs file in an ASP.NET Core application?

[ ]To configure the application’s services, middleware, and request pipeline

[ ]To manage database interactions for the application

[ ]To handle incoming HTTP requests and responses

[ ]To define all API routes used by the application



### 2.

Question 2

What is the role of controllers when creating a simple web API in ASP.NET Core?

[ ]To define all services used by the application

[ ]To handle incoming HTTP requests and define the logic for responses

[ ]To configure middleware components for the application

[ ]To automatically map HTTP methods to database queries


### 3.

Question 3

How do you implement a POST endpoint in an ASP.NET Core web API?

[ ]By configuring POST handling in the Startup.cs file

[ ]By mapping the HTTP POST method to a route using app.MapPost()

[ ]By adding POST logic directly to the Program.cs file

[ ]By modifying the appsettings.json file


### 4.

Question 4

Why is middleware sequencing important in an ASP.NET Core application?

[ ]The order of middleware determines how requests and responses are processed in the pipeline

[ ]Middleware always runs independently of sequencing

[ ]Middleware is automatically executed in the order of controller actions

[ ]Middleware only affects incoming requests, not responses


### 5.

Question 5

How do you test a simple web API in ASP.NET Core?

[ ]By using tools like Postman to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints

[ ]By editing the appsettings.json file to simulate API requests

[ ]By creating custom middleware for testing endpoints

[ ]By directly modifying routes in the Program.cs file
