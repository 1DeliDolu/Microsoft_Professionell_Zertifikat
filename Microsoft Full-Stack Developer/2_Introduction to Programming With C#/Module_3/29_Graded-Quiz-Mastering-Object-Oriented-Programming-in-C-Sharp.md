Question 1

Which best describes a class in object-oriented programming (OOP)?

[ ]A collection of unrelated functions

[ ]A single instance of an object

[ ]A method that performs actions within an object

[ ]A blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of objects

Question 2

How does inheritance help with code reuse in OOP?

[ ]It ensures that methods cannot be overridden in the base class.

[ ]It creates new methods unrelated to the base class.

[ ]It allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from a base class.

[ ]It restricts access to methods within a class.

Question 3

What is the benefit of using polymorphism in C#?

[ ]It prevents objects from sharing methods

[ ]It allows a single method to behave differently based on the object it interacts with

[ ]It restricts method access to only the base class

[ ]It ensures that all objects have the same methods

Question 4

What problem does the Singleton design pattern solve?

[ ]It defines a set of methods that must be implemented

[ ]It manages the communication between different objects

[ ]It allows for dynamic creation of objects based on user input

[ ]It ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the program

Question 5

How do constructors in C# support object creation?

[ ]They provide a way to initialize an object’s state when the object is created.

[ ]They restrict access to the object’s methods.

[ ]They define methods that can be inherited by subclasses.

[ ]They allow multiple instances of the same object.

Question 6

How does encapsulation help in securing data in OOP?

[ ]By preventing methods from being overridden

[ ]By allowing multiple objects to share the same methods

[ ]By restricting direct access to object properties and exposing them through methods

[ ]By ensuring that all objects have private attributes

1 point

### 7.

Question 7

Why would a developer use method overriding in C#?

[ ]To force the derived class to use the base class method implementation

[ ]To change the behavior of a method in a derived class without affecting the base class

[ ]To prevent methods from being inherited by other classes

[ ]To restrict access to certain methods in the derived class

1 point

### 8.

Question 8

What is the role of a constructor in object-oriented programming?

[ ]To set initial values for the object’s attributes when it is instantiated

[ ]To inherit methods from a base class

[ ]To control access to methods in a class

[ ]To create multiple objects from a single class

1 point

### 9.

Question 9

How does an interface differ from a class in C#?

[ ]An interface ensures only one object can be created from the class

[ ]An interface defines method signatures without implementation, while a class can provide full method implementation

[ ]An interface can contain method implementations, while a class cannot

[ ]An interface restricts a class from having multiple methods

Question 10

What does abstraction achieve in object-oriented programming?

[ ]It ensures that all objects have the same methods

[ ]It hides the implementation details and exposes only the necessary functionality

[ ]It forces all methods to have the same signature

[ ]It prevents objects from inheriting methods
