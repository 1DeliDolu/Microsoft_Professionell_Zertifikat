**Question 3**

How does Entity Framework Core simplify database operations in ASP.NET Core applications?

[x] By allowing developers to work with database records using .NET objects without writing SQL queries

*That’s correct! EF Core enables developers to perform CRUD operations through LINQ and .NET objects, abstracting away the need fo*r direct SQL queries.


[ ] By managing server-side caching for database queries
[ ] By automatically optimizing database performance during runtime
[ ] By automating the generation of user interfaces for database entities
