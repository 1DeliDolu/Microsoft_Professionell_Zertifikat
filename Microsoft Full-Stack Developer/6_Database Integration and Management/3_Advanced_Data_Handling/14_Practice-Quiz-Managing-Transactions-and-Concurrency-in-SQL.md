### 1. Question 1

How does concurrency control benefit multi-user environments in SQL?

* [X] It prevents data conflicts when multiple users access data simultaneously

That’s correct! Concurrency control manages simultaneous data access, ensuring data integrity by preventing conflicts and maintaining accuracy.

* [ ] It enables users to access the same data without restrictions
* [ ] It restricts database usage to only one user to avoid conflicts
* [ ] It speeds up data processing by allowing parallel transactions

### 3. Question 3

What is the purpose of SQL transactions in maintaining data integrity?

* [ ] They allow unrestricted access to all database users
* [ ] They break down database changes into smaller, manageable tasks
* [X] They ensure that database changes occur as a single, reliable unit
