[ ]Methods to create and display graphics on the screen

[ ]Ways to store and retrieve data

[ ]Fundamental components that control the flow and decision-making in code

[ ]Simple tasks performed by a computer processor


### 2.

Question 2

Select 3 of the following types of logic used in programming.

[ ]Conditional logic

[ ]Pointer Logic

[ ]Boolean Logic

[ ]Loop logic


### 3.

Question 3

How can developers use pseudocode effectively before writing actual code?

[ ]To directly execute the program without errors in any programming environment, ensuring code runs perfectly

[ ]To replace the need for any further documentation or comments within the final code itself

[ ]To design user interfaces by visually laying out all elements, buttons, and interactions within the program

[ ]To a outline a detailed description of what a computer program must do, expressed in a natural language


### 4.

Question 4

Which tool would best visualize a sequence of steps in a program?

[ ]Flowchart

[ ]Debugger

[ ]Pseudocode

[ ]Integrated Development Environment


### 5.

Question 5

Which of the following best describes the role of logical processes in programming, and why are they important?

[ ]Logical processes automate the deployment of code to production environments.

[ ]Logical processes are used to manage the physical memory and hardware resources of the computer.

[ ]Logical processes focus on user interface design and making the program visually appealing.

[ ]Logical processes involve using conditional statements, loops, and decision-making structures to control the flow of a program, ensuring that it behaves correctly under different conditions.
