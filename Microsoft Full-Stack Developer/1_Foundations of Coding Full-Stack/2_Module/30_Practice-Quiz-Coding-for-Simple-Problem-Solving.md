Question 3

What is the benefit of decomposing a complex problem into smaller parts?

[ ]It eliminates the need for testing the solution

[ ]It decreases the number of resources required to solve the problem

[X]It makes the problem easier to understand and solve incrementally

That's correct! Breaking down complex problems allows programmers to handle smaller, more manageable parts, simplifying the solution process.

[ ]It ensures all parts of the problem are solved simultaneously

Question 4

Which statement best describes the top-down approach in problem-solving?

[ ]Building a solution from the smallest details up to the complete system

[X]Breaking down a system into smaller components, starting from the highest level

That's correct! The top-down approach involves dividing a problem into smaller, more manageable parts, beginning with the overall structure.

[ ]Addressing specific issues

[ ]Focusing on improving individual components without considering the overall system

Question 5

Which of the following represents a guideline for writing effective pseudocode?

[ ]Use complex syntax to mirror real programming languages

[ ]Include as many technical terms as possible

[ ]Writing it all quickly so you don’t forget anything

[X]Use clear, plain language to describe each logical step

That's correct! Writing pseudocode in simple language helps ensure it is understandable and easily translated into actual code.
