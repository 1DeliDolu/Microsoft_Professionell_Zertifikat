Question 3

When solving a problem with deductive reasoning, what should you focus on first?

[ ]Start testing the code

[ ]Defining all the variables at once

[X]Outlining the known premises or assumptions of the problem

Question 4

How does deductive reasoning help in debugging a programming error?

[ ]It focuses on rewriting the entire codebase

[ ]It helps in making intuitive guesses about where the bug might be

[X]It helps to systematically identify the root cause by starting from known facts

That's correct! Deductive reasoning allows developers to use logical steps to identify the root cause of an error based on known facts.

[ ]It allows trying different coding methods randomly until one works
