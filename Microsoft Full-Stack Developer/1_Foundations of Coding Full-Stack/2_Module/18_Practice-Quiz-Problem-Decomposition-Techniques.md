Question 1

What is one primary benefit of decomposing a complex problem when debugging in software development?

[ ]It eliminates the need for testing

[X]It allows developers to isolate and fix issues in smaller parts of the code

That's correct! By breaking down the problem into smaller parts, developers can isolate and fix issues more efficiently.

Question 3

You need to build a website for an online bookstore. Which of the following steps aligns with a top-down approach to problem decomposition?

[ ]Focus on creating independent modules for the payment system first.

[ ]Begin by coding the homepage first with images and navigation structure.

[X]Start by defining the overall goal, then break it into main sections, such as the homepage, product pages, and checkout process.

That's correct! The top-down approach starts with a broad goal and breaks it into smaller, more manageable parts.

[ ]Develop the user authentication feature before any other components.

Question 4

What is the first step in decomposing a complex problem for debugging and implementation?

[X]Identify the problem or goal

That's correct! The first step in problem decomposition is identifying the problem or goal to be addressed.

[ ]Start coding immediately

[ ]Integrate the solution components

[ ]Analyze and address each part separately
