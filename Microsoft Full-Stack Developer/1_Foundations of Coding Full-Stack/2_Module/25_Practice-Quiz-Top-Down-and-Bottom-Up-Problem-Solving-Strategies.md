Question 1

Which of the following describes the initial step in applying the top-down approach to problem-solving in software development?

[ ]Start with a single modules and test thoroughly

[ ]Integrate components into a complete system

[ ]Gather more information before starting development

[X]Create a broad design goal or problem statement

That's correct! The top-down approach begins by defining a broad goal or problem, broken down into smaller, manageable parts.

Question 2

What is the primary focus when using the bottom-up approach in software development?

[ ]Focusing on the overall design before creating any components.

[ ]Defining a broad problem and breaking it down into smaller tasks.

[X]Building small, manageable components and integrating them into a complete solution.

That's correct! The bottom-up approach focuses on developing and combining individual parts to form a comprehensive system.

[ ]Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the system requirements.

Question 3

Which of the following is a key difference between the top-down and bottom-up approaches?

[X]The top-down approach focuses on gathering more information, while the bottom-up approach focuses on immediate solutions

That's correct! The top-down approach starts with a broader understanding and moves toward specifics, while the bottom-up approach starts with detailed components and builds toward a complete solution.

[ ]The top-down approach is always faster than the bottom-down approach

[ ]The bottom-up approach focuses on gathering more information, while the top-down approach focuses on implementing immediate solutions

[ ]The bottom-up approach is always faster than the top-down approach

Question 4

In which scenario would it be most appropriate to use the bottom-up approach over the top-down approach?

[X]When developing software that involves creating a new feature with a specific requirement

That's correct. The bottom-up approach works best when building specific features with clear requirements, as it allows you to focus on implementing components first.

[X]When the problem requires exploration and the details are unclear

That's correct! The bottom-up approach is beneficial when there is uncertainty, allowing for flexibility and exploration in development.

[ ]When the overall design needs to be completed before focusing on specific details

[ ]When there is a clearly defined high-level goal and limited resources
