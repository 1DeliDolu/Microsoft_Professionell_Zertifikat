Question 1

Why are iterations important in programming?

[ ]They ensure program accuracy by enforcing a strict order of execution

[ ]They prioritize performance over logical consistency

[X]They allow repetitive tasks to be executed until a specific condition is met

[ ]They divide tasks into smaller, non-repetitive units for clarity

Correct

That’s correct! Iterations, or loops, are key for handling repetitive processes efficiently.

Question 2

What is the purpose of identifying premises in deductive reasoning?

[ ]To compare multiple conclusions for accuracy

[X]To establish a foundation for drawing logical conclusions

[ ]To verify the reliability of external information sources

[ ]To eliminate irrelevant details from the problem-solving process

Correct

That’s correct! Identifying premises helps to structure logical steps toward solving a problem.

Question 3

What is the primary goal of problem decomposition?

[ ]To establish a logical hierarchy among program components

[X]To break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components

[ ]To ensure a linear approach to completing a task

[ ]To optimize code by reducing unnecessary repetition

Correct

That’s correct! Problem decomposition simplifies complex tasks and makes them more approachable.

Question 4

How do top-down and bottom-up approaches differ in application?

[ ]Top-down relies on modules, while bottom-up does not

[X]Top-down starts with a broad goal, while bottom-up focuses on individual components first

[ ]Top-down solves problems visually, while bottom-up is purely logic-driven

[ ]Top-down begins with coding, while bottom-up starts with system integration

Correct

That’s correct! Each approach suits different types of problems and goals.

Question 5

Why should pseudocode be written in plain language?

[ ]To minimize redundancy in program explanations

[ ]To ensure compatibility with various programming environments

[X]To make it easily understandable by developers and stakeholders

[ ]To meet technical documentation standards in software projects

Correct

That’s correct! Writing in plain language ensures that pseudocode is accessible to a broad audience.

### 6.

Question 6

What is the first step in the top-down problem-solving approach?

[ ]Develop and test the most critical elements of the system first

[ ]Assemble the solution without focusing on the broader problem

[ ]Develop individual components for the system

[X]Identify the broad problem or goal

Correct

That’s correct! The top-down approach begins with defining a clear overarching goal.

### 7.

Question 7

When should you choose the bottom-up approach over the top-down approach?

[ ]When rapid prototyping is prioritized over detailed module design

[X]When components are developed independently and then integrated into a system

[ ]When an overall framework needs to be established before coding begins

[ ]When analyzing problems from a high-level perspective is required

Correct

That’s correct! The bottom-up method works well when building individual modules first.

Question 8

How do control structures affect the flow of a program?

[ ]They ensure tasks are executed in the order they are written

[X]They direct the program to execute code based on specific conditions

[ ]They create visual clarity for the code’s logical flow

[ ]They define how variables are declared and managed in a program

Correct

That’s correct! Control structures like if-else statements help programs respond dynamically to various inputs.

Question 9

How does problem decomposition contribute to program maintenance?

[ ]By centralizing all program logic into a single module for easier reference

[ ]By ensuring that only one section of the program ever needs debugging

[ ]By eliminating the need for detailed comments or documentation

[X]By organizing the code into smaller sections, making updates easier

Correct

That’s correct! Decomposition helps maintain clarity and facilitates modifications or additions to the codebase.

### 10.

Question 10

What is an important advantage of using pseudocode in the development process?

[ ]It eliminates the need for debugging after writing the actual code

[ ]It automatically generates optimized algorithms for implementation

[X]It helps bridge the gap between problem-solving and coding implementation

[ ]It provides a direct execution plan for the compiler

Correct

That’s correct! Pseudocode serves as a guide to transition from logic to actual code effectively.
