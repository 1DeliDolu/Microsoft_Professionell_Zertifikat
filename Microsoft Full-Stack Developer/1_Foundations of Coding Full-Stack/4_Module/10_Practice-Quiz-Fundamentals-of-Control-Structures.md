Question 1

What is the primary purpose of using an if-else statement in programming?

[ ]To store data values for later use in programs.

[ ]To define a reusable block of code for tasks.

[ ]To repeat a block of code multiple times.

[ ]To choose between actions based on a condition.


### 2.

Question 2

Which scenario is most suitable for using a switch statement instead of an if-else statement?

[ ]When choosing actions based on multiple values

[ ]When defining data storage to use in programs

[ ]When creating functions for repeated operations

[ ]When executing code until a condition is met

Question 3

You are developing a program that assigns grades based on a student's score. Which control structure is more efficient for handling multiple grade ranges (A, B, C, D, F)?

[ ]Use a for loop to handle all grade ranges instead

[ ]Use an if-else statement to handle grade ranges

[ ]Use a switch statement to handle grade ranges

[ ]Use a while loop to handle all grade ranges instead

Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the correct syntax of an if-else statement in C# to check if a number is greater than 10?

[ ]if (number > 10) { Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10"); } else { Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less"); }

[ ]if number > 10 { Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10"); } else { Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less"); }

[ ]if (number > 10) Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10") else Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less");

[ ]if (number > 10): Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10"); else: Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less");




### 5.

Question 5

What is the primary purpose of the "default" case in a switch statement?

[ ]To handle any values that do not match the specified cases.

[ ]To specify the first case to be checked in a switch statement.

[ ]To terminate the switch statement early.

[ ]To group multiple cases into one block.



### 1) Question 1

✅ **To choose between actions based on a condition.**

That's correct! If-else statements are used to make decisions in code by executing different actions depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

### 2) Question 2

✅ **When choosing actions based on multiple values**

That's correct! A switch statement is ideal when you have multiple cases for a single variable and must select one of several actions based on the variable's value.

### 3) Question 3

✅ **Use a switch statement to handle grade ranges**

That's correct! A switch statement is more efficient and readable for handling multiple discrete grade ranges, as it simplifies the code structure compared to nested if-else statements.

### 4) Question 4

✅ **if (number > 10) { Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10"); } else { Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less"); }**

That's correct! This is the correct syntax for an if-else statement in C#, which includes the condition inside parentheses and the respective code blocks inside curly braces.

### 5) Question 5

✅ **To handle any values that do not match the specified cases.**

That's correct! The "default" case in a switch statement acts as a fallback to handle situations where none of the other cases match the variable's value.
