Question 1

Which of the following demonstrates a correct method to combine an if-else statement with a loop in a coding exercise?

[ X ]Use a loop to go through each item in a list and place an if-else statement inside the loop to check conditions.

[ ]Use multiple nested loops to avoid using if-else statements for simplicity.

[ ]Use a single if-else statement before the loop to check all conditions in advance.

[ ]Place the loop inside an if-else statement so it only executes when the condition is met.

Question 2

What is the primary benefit of combining switch cases with loops in a coding exercise?

[ ]To ensure the loop stops automatically when a matching case is found in the loop

[ ]To execute all cases in a switch statement regardless of the variable’s value

[ ]To repeat a single code block multiple times without considering the value of the variable

[ X ]To evaluate different values of a variable and perform specific actions while iterating

Question 3

Which of the following C# code snippets correctly combines control structures and loops?

[ ]int i = 0;

while (i < 5)
{
    i++;
    if (i > 2)
        break;
}
Console.WriteLine("Loop finished");

[ ]for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)

{
     switch (i)
     {
         case 3:
             Console.WriteLine("Value is 3");
             break;
      }
}

[ X ]for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)

{
   if (i % 2 == 0)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Even number: " + i);
   {
   else
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Odd number: " + i);
   }
}

[ ]while (true)

{
   Console.WriteLine("Running");
   if (true)
   {
        continue;
   }
   break;
}
