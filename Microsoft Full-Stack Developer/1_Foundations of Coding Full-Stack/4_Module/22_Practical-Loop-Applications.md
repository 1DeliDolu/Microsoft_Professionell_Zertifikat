Question 1

What is the primary purpose of a "for” loop in programming?

[ ]To execute a code block at least once before checking a condition

[ ]To handle decision-making between different conditions

[ ]To manage repeated actions when the number of iterations is unknown

[ ]To automate repetitive tasks when the number of iterations is known


### 2.

Question 2

When would you use a "while loop" in programming?

[ ]When you need to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of the condition

[ ]When you want the loop to run a specific number of times

[ ]When you need to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is true

[ ]When you want to handle multiple decision paths in a program



### 3.

Question 3

What is a key characteristic of a "do-while loop" that distinguishes it from other loops?

[ ]It is identical in functionality to a "for loop."

[ ]It is only used for numerical operations

[ ]It guarantees the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition

[ ]It checks the condition before executing the code block



### 4.

Question 4

Why are loops (for, while, do-while) important in programming?

[ ]They efficiently handle repetitive tasks with minimal code

[ ]They are used solely for error handling

[ ]They help define variables and functions

[ ]They are best used to manage user input



### 1) Question 1

**Doğru cevap:** **To automate repetitive tasks when the number of iterations is known**

That's correct! A "for loop" executes a block of code repeatedly when the number of iterations is known.

---

### 2) Question 2

**Doğru cevap:** **When you need to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is true**

That's correct! A "while loop" executes the code block if the condition remains true.

---

### 3) Question 3

**Doğru cevap:** **It guarantees the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition**

That's correct! A "do-while loop" executes the code block first and then checks the condition, ensuring at least one execution.

---

### 4) Question 4

**Doğru cevap:** **They efficiently handle repetitive tasks with minimal code**

That's correct! Loops allow for the efficient execution of repeated tasks, making code more concise and easier to manage.
