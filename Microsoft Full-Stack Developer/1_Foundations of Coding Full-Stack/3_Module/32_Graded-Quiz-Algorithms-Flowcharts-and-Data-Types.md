Question 1

A school groups students into different learning levels based on their scores: beginner (0–50), intermediate (51–80), and advanced (81–100). What kind of logic is used in this algorithm?

[X]Categorical logic

[ ]Iterative logic

[ ]Arithmetic logic

[ ]Binary logic

Correct

That's correct! Categorical logic organizes data into predefined groups based on specific criteria.

Question 3

A program stores a user’s age, which is always a whole number. What is the most appropriate data type?

[ ]float

[ ]string

[X]int

[ ]bool

Correct

That's correct! The integer data type stores whole numbers, making it ideal for an age variable.

Question 4

How would you declare a variable in C# to store the name of a product?

[ ]float productName;

[ ]int productName;

[X]string productName;

[ ]bool productName;

Correct

That's correct! The string data type is used to store textual data in C#.

Question 5

In a login process flowchart, the step for "Enter credentials" uses the correct rectangle symbol. However, no output is displayed if invalid credentials are entered. How can you modify the flowchart to handle this scenario?

[ ]Add an additional arrow leading to the start of the process

[ ]Change the rectangle for "Enter credentials" to an oval

[ ]Remove the "Enter credentials" step and replace it with a diamond

[X]Add a decision point after the "Enter credentials" step to check if the credentials are valid

Correct

That's correct! Adding a decision point after entering credentials allows the process to check validity and direct the flow accordingly.

Question 6

A program stores a user’s age, which is always a whole number. What is the most appropriate data type?

[ ]string

[ ]bool

[ ]float

[X]int

Correct

That's correct! The integer data type stores whole numbers, making it ideal for an age variable.

Question 7

A program calculates the total bill for a customer, including tax. What is the correct step in the algorithm?

[X]Add the subtotal to the tax to get the total bill

[ ]Divide the tax by the subtotal

[ ]Subtract the tax from the subtotal

[ ]Multiply the subtotal by the total bill

Correct

That's correct! Adding the subtotal and tax calculates the total bill.

### 8.

Question 8

A program is designed to add three numbers and display the result. Which of the following correctly declares the necessary variables in C#?

[ ]int number1: 5, number2: 10, number3: 15;

[ ]declare (int) number1, number2, number3

[ ]define number1 = 5, number2 = 10, number3 = 15

[X]int number1 = 5, number2 = 10, number3 = 15;

Correct

That’s correct! C# requires variables to be declared with a data type, such as int, followed by the variable names and values.

### 9.

Question 9

A program tracks whether a user is logged in or not. Which C# variable declaration is most appropriate?

[ ]string isLoggedIn = "false";

[ ]float isLoggedIn = 0.0f;

[X]bool isLoggedIn = false;

[ ]int isLoggedIn = 0;

Correct

That's correct! Booleans store true/false values, making them suitable for tracking login status.

### 10.

Question 10

A program calculates the area of a triangle using the base and height. Which code snippet correctly implements this algorithm in C#?

[ ]float area = base + height;

[ ]float area = base / height;

[X]float area = 0.5f * base * height;

[ ]float area = base * height;

Correct

That's correct! The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height, and float is appropriate for decimal values.
