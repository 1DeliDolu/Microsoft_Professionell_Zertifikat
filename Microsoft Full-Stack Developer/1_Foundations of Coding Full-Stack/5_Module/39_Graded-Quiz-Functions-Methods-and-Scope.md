Question 1

Imagine a developer is tasked with creating a shopping cart application. Why would they use a function to calculate the total cost of items in the cart?

[ ]To ensure code reusability and avoid duplicating logic for calculating totals across multiple parts of the program

[ ]To prevent other parts of the program from accessing the total cost

[ ]To generate a user interface automatically

[ ]To reduce the time required to write the entire application

Question 2

A developer writes a method in C# with the signature public int CalculateSum(int a, int b). What does the int return type mean?

[ ]The method cannot be called without arguments

[ ]The method will always return the same value

[ ]The method will return an integer value after performing the calculation

[ ]The method must be defined as static

Question 3

A developer wants to reuse a function that calculates the area of a rectangle in multiple parts of a program. How should they ensure the function can handle different rectangle dimensions?

[ ]Write separate functions for each rectangle size

[ ]Call the function without arguments to use default values

[ ]Use parameters to pass the length and width into the function each time it is called

[ ]Use a global variable to store the dimensions

Question 4

Why would a method that processes a list of items return the total count of processed items?

[ ]The total count prevents errors during processing

[ ]The total count provides a useful result for other parts of the program, like displaying the count to the user

[ ]The total count reduces the program’s overall memory usage

[ ]The total count ensures all items in the list were processed correctly

Question 5

A developer uses parameters in a function. How do parameters enhance code reusability?

[ ]They automatically validate the input data

[ ]They eliminate the need for loops inside the function

[ ]They prevent the function from being called multiple times

[ ]They allow functions to process different inputs without changing the function’s code

Question 6

What is the result of calling PrintMessage() on a method defined as public void PrintMessage(string message)?

[ ]The call will fail because the method requires a string parameter to execute

[ ]The call will pass an empty string automatically to the method

[ ]The call will create a runtime error but continue program execution

[ ]The call will succeed but produce no output

Question 7

Why are methods with return values preferred for complex calculations?

[ ]They prevent errors during calculations

[ ]They eliminate the need for parameters

[ ]They ensure faster execution than methods without return values

[ ]They allow the calculated result to be reused in other parts of the program

Question 8

What happens when parameters are not used in a method that processes order details?

[ ]The method will store all order details in global variables

[ ]The method cannot handle different inputs dynamically and becomes less reusable

[ ]The method will not require any return value

[ ]The method will fail to execute entirely

Question 9

You are developing a library management system. Why would you create a function to calculate overdue fines based on the number of days late?

[ ]To eliminate the need for parameters in the calculation

[ ]To replace conditional statements in the program

[ ]To allow the calculation logic to be reused whenever fines need to be determined for different users

[ ]To ensure the fine is automatically deducted from the user’s account

Question 10

What is the advantage of planning a program by dividing it into smaller functions or methods?

[ ]It eliminates the need for loops and conditionals in the program

[ ]It guarantees that the program will run without errors

[ ]It allows all functions to share the same global variables

[ ]It makes the program easier to debug, test, and update, as each function handles a specific task
