Question 1

Imagine you are designing a banking application. Which approach ensures the program is modular and easier to maintain by combining related tasks like checking balances and processing withdrawals?

[ ]Store all program logic in global variables

[ ]Use separate programming languages for different tasks

[ ]Use functions and methods to modularize tasks and interactions

[ ]Write a single function to handle all tasks in the program


### 2.

Question 2

You are tasked with building an inventory system. What is the most efficient way to handle repetitive tasks, such as calculating total stock value?

[ ]Use a function or method to encapsulate the calculation logic and reuse it as needed

[ ]Copy and paste the code wherever it is needed

[ ]Use global variables to store the stock value

[ ]Write the logic repeatedly in every section of the program


### 3.

Question 3

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive library management system. How should you integrate user authentication, book checkouts, and returns into the program?

[ ]Focus only on testing individual functions at this stage

[ ]Write each function independently without considering integration

[ ]Store all interactions in a single global variable for easier access

[ ]Plan the program flow by defining how functions and methods will interact



### 4.

Question 4

In a library management system, which programming principle ensures each function or method is responsible for only one task, such as checking out books or adding new titles?

[ ]Single Responsibility Principle

[ ]Efficiency Principle

[ ]Object-Oriented Programming Principle

[ ]Modularity Principle
