Question 1

Which of the following statements best defines a method in C#?

[ ]A method is only used for simple tasks, while functions handle more complex tasks.

[ ]A method is a function associated with an object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

[ ]A method is a block of code that cannot modify data in an object.

[ ]A method is a standalone block of reusable code that can exist independently.

Question 2

Which of the following correctly declares a static method in C#?

[ ]public static AddNumbers(int a, int b) { a + b; }

[ ]public int static AddNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

[ ]static public AddNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

[ ]public static int AddNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }


### 3.

Question 3

You are developing a program to manage an inventory. Which of the following tasks would be best suited for a method?

[ ]Calculating the total value of all items in stock

[ ]Changing the visual appearance of the program's interface

[ ]Writing a database query to retrieve all records

[ ]Defining a new class to represent a product


### 4.

Question 4

This method contains an error: private static AddNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }. Identify and correct the issue.

[ ]The method is missing a return type before AddNumbers. The corrected version is: private static int AddNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }.

[ ]The method does not require a return type if it is static.

[ ]The static modifier is misplaced. It should be after the return type.

[ ]The method cannot be private if it is static.


### 5.

Question 5

Which of the following best describes the distinction between a method and a function?

[ ] A method is always more complex than a function.

[ ]A method cannot return values, but a function can.

[ ]Methods and functions are identical and can be used interchangeably.

[ ]A method operates within the context of a class, while a function is independent of a class.
