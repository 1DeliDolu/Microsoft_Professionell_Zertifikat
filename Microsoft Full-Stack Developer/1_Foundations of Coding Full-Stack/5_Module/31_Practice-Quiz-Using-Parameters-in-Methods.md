Question 1

What is the role of parameters in methods?

[ ]They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the method when it is called

[ ]They define the method name

[ ]They store the result of the method

[ ]They specify the return type of the method


### 2.

Question 2

How is data passed into methods using parameters?

[ ]By listing the parameter types and names in the method definition

[ ]By placing the output value in the parameter list

[ ]By specifying the return type in the method definition

[ ]By writing the method name in the parentheses

### 3.

Question 3

How can parameters enhance the functionality of a method?

Scenario: A developer creates a method called CalculateDiscount that determines the discount amount for a purchase. The method uses the price and discount rate as inputs.

[ ]They eliminate the need for multiple methods

[ ]They reduce the need for return values

[ ]They improve the performance of the method

[ ]They allow the method to accept different inputs without modifying the method

### 4.

Question 4

What do parameters allow when passing data into methods?

Scenario: A method called CalculateSum accepts two numbers as inputs and returns their sum. The numbers passed to the method can vary.

[ ]They ensure the same value is passed into the method every time

[ ]They allow different values to be passed into a method during execution

[ ]They specify how the method will return its output

[ ]They prevent data from being passed to the method
